# Edmonton
My journey through solving the problems on Project Euler in C++17.

### What is Project Euler?
[Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net) is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

### What is Edmonton?
A very Canadian pun, playing off the fact that the hockey team of Edmonton is called the Oilers. The aim of this repository is to serve as a storage and archive of all the solutions in a hopefully fairly idiomatic expression of C++.

The problems are organized in folders using numbers corresponding to the relevant question. Each comes with a collection of one or more `*.cpp` files that must be compiled.

Some of the problems may require additional libaries in regards to large integers, which is done using boost.

The template folder contains a basic cpp file with prefilled starting stuff like the relevant headers, namespace and main function to make it quick to start a new problem; albeit it is a bit basic at the moment.

### Cheating
While there is nothing stopping you from simply running the solutions and inputting the answers yourself, please ask yourself if you would like to miss the wonderful challenge provided by the site and the missed forays into CS and Mathematics they provide.
