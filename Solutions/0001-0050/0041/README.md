# Problem 41: [Pandigital Prime](https://projecteuler.net/problem=41)

## Thoughts
A pandigital number that has digits summing up to a number that is divisible by 3 rules out that class of pandigital numbers of being prime. As such the only two possiblities are four and seven digital pandigital numbers. There are exactly `7! = 5040` pandigital numbers with a length of seven digits. Then the only remaining thing to do is to go backwards from `7654321` and find the largest prime we can.
